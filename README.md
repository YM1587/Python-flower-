# Turtle Flower Drawing

## Overview
This Python script uses the `turtle` module to draw a colorful flower with leaves. The flower consists of a red base and two green leaves, creating an aesthetically pleasing floral design using basic turtle graphics functions.

## Features
- Draws a flower with a curved base and petals.
- Adds two symmetrical green leaves to enhance the design.
- Uses `turtle` graphics for a simple yet elegant drawing.

## Prerequisites
To run this script, you need to have Python installed on your system. The `turtle` module comes pre-installed with Python, so no additional installations are required.

## Installation & Usage
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Copy and paste the script into a Python file (e.g., `flower.py`).
3. Run the script using the following command:
   ```sh
   python flower.py
   ```
4. A turtle graphics window will open, and the flower will be drawn step by step.

## Code Breakdown
- **`draw_flower()`**: The main function that executes all drawing steps.
- **Flower Base**: Created using arcs and circles to form a curved shape.
- **Petal 2**: Adjusts angles to give depth to the drawing.
- **Leaves**: Two green leaves are drawn using circular arcs.

## Expected Output
When the script runs successfully, a red flower with a structured stem and two green leaves will be drawn using turtle graphics.

## Customization
You can modify the colors or shapes by adjusting the `fillcolor()` function and changing the arc angles in the `circle()` function.
